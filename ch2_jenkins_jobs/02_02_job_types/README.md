# 02_02 Job types

In this lesson, you’ll get an overview of the different job types available in Jenkins. Each job type serves a specific use case, from simple tasks to advanced pipeline automation.

- **Freestyle Project:**
  - Most common job type.
  - Provides flexible options for configuring and running jobs.

- **Pipeline:**
  - Designed for more complex projects.
  - Allows chaining multiple stages together.
  - Job configurations are captured as code.

- **Multi-Configuration Project:**
  - Useful for running jobs with different combinations of parameters.
  - Reduces the need to create multiple separate jobs.

- **Multibranch Pipeline:**
  - Automatically creates jobs for different branches in a repository.
  - Ideal for projects with multiple active branches.

- **Organization Folder:**
  - Scans code repositories for specific files.
  - Automatically configures jobs for projects within an organization.

- **Folder:**
  - Not a job type, but used to group jobs and organize the Jenkins environment.

> [!NOTE]
> This course will primarily focus on the **Freestyle Project** job type.
