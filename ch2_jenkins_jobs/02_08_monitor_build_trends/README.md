# 02_08 Monitor build trends

The **Build Trend** chart provides a visual summary of job history, showing build status and duration over time. This helps you track the stability and performance of your jobs at a glance.

- **Accessing the Build Trend Chart:**
  - Next to the build history for a job select the **Expand** icon.
  - This opens a timeline chart displaying the status of each build.

- **Reading the Build Trend Report:**
  - The chart shows when each build ran and its success or failure status.
  - Below the chart is a report with:
    - Build durations
    - Build success and failure indicators
  - This helps you track trends in build times and monitor overall job stability.
