# 05_03 Next Steps with Jenkins

We covered a lot in this course, and even though this is the end, it's really just the beginning.

I encourage you to apply Jenkins to real projects; stay curious and learn as much as you can about this powerful automation platform.

As you continue your automation journey, come back to the LinkedIn Learning library for more courses on Jenkins.

It's been my pleasure to be your instructor for Learning Jenkins and I can’t wait to see what you automate.
