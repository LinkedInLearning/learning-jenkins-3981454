# 01_06 Finish a Jenkins installation

After installing Jenkins, you'll need to complete a few more steps to get it up and running. This guide will walk you through the final installation steps.

## Step 1: Unlock Jenkins

When you first access Jenkins, you'll be prompted to unlock it using the initial administrator password. This password was generated during installation and can be found in the location shown on the unlock screen.

Jenkins will present you with two options for plugin installation. The recommended approach is to install the suggested plugins, which include essential tools for building, deploying, and automating your projects.

## Step 4: Configure Jenkins URL

Set up the Jenkins URL that will be used to access your Jenkins instance. This is typically the same URL you used to access the unlock page.

Once the installation is complete, you'll see the Jenkins dashboard. This is your main interface for managing jobs, builds, and system configurations.
