# 01_07 The Jenkins user interface

In this lesson, you'll get familiar with the main menus and interface elements of Jenkins. Understanding where to find key features will help you work more efficiently as you build and manage jobs.

- **New Item** link (left sidebar):
  - Used to create jobs or other resources.

- **Manage Jenkins** menu:
  - Provides access to server configuration options.
  - You may see a security message about building on the controller node—safe to dismiss for this course.
  - Two key sections to know:
    - **Tools**: Configure external programs Jenkins can use across jobs.
    - **Manage Plugins**: Install or update plugins that add functionality to Jenkins.

- **Build Queue**:
  - Shows jobs that are waiting to run.

- **Build Executor Status**:
  - Shows jobs currently running.
