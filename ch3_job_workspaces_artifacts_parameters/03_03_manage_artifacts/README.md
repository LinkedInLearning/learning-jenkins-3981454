## Artifacts

In the context of Jenkins, an *artifact* is any file or set of files that a build job produces as its final deliverable. These files capture the tangible outcome of the build and are typically archived, published, or handed off to other jobs for testing, deployment, or analysis.

Examples artifacts include:

- Compiled executables, such as an `.exe` file
- Packaged archives, such as a `.jar` or `.zip` files
- Reports or logs stored saved as `.txt` or `.log` files
